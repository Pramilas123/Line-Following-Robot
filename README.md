# Line-Following-Robot
ðŸ¤– Line Following Robot
This project involves the design and development of an autonomous line following robot that can detect and follow a predefined path using infrared (IR) sensors. The robot is capable of navigating along a black line on a white surface (or vice versa), making real-time decisions to adjust its direction based on sensor inputs.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
IR Sensor Array for accurate line detection

Motor Driver for precise control of DC motors

Microcontroller (Arduino/ESP32) to process sensor data and execute movement logic

PID Control (optional) for smoother and more stable turning performance

Supports basic to complex tracks (e.g., curves, junctions, T-intersections)

ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used:
Arduino/ESP32 (C/C++ programming)

IR Sensors, DC Motors, L298N Motor Driver

Optional: Battery-powered mobile chassis, onboard display for debugging
